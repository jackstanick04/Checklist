now into the java swing
    - 4 pages that will be put in a cardlayout so that one is showed at a time
        - page for the title screen (will output the lists and also the buttons)
        - edit screen (will have options of what list and stuff to edit)
        - create list screen (will take user input)
        - delete list screen (most simple and just takes number)
    - will have to somehow both format and then connect the programming

got buttons to pass between pages
will now need to work on    
    - formatting the lists on the main page
    - taking input on the other pages and actually updating the data

Done
    - logic and formatting for the home and delete page
Next steps 
    - logic and formatting for the add and edit pages
    - make things look pretty
Appearance (create and edit)
    - dont display, just have a couple form things (like the delete question)
    - for the create, go back to the home page, for the edit, maybe ask if they are done and if not refresh?
        - could do this same idea of asking and refreshing for adding items during list intialization

Did the formatting for the create page, need to actually implement all of the logic next

Edit page   
    - have the original edit page with working buttons and done button (refreshes)
    - every other edit page needs to be made
