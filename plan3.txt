now into the java swing
    - 4 pages that will be put in a cardlayout so that one is showed at a time
        - page for the title screen (will output the lists and also the buttons)
        - edit screen (will have options of what list and stuff to edit)
        - create list screen (will take user input)
        - delete list screen (most simple and just takes number)
    - will have to somehow both format and then connect the programming

got buttons to pass between pages
will now need to work on    
    - formatting the lists on the main page
    - taking input on the other pages and actually updating the data

Done
    - logic and formatting for the home and delete page
Next steps 
    - logic and formatting for the add and edit pages
    - make things look pretty
