The following are the general ideas of each file
    - the class will run from the main program, with plenty of terminal options to enter/complete tasks
    - the tasks will all be their own item, with attributes like completed/description
    - the user can create checklists, which will be arraylists of tasks and have their own method like add/complete task, etc.
The following is the ordered steps (obviously checking that eveyrthing works as we go on)
    - also make a date object which can be used when making a task
    - first create item class and its attributes and instance methods to update and act iteself
    - then make the checklist class after the item classs works
    - the difficult part will be the main program and having everything work (will probably need many methods and switches)
What has been done so far
    - date class basics have been made and tested
    - task class basics have been made and tested
    - task, date, and checklist complete with methods and variables

now need to work on the main method interface and userness
