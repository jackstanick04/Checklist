The following are the general ideas of each file
    - the class will run from the main program, with plenty of terminal options to enter/complete tasks
    - the tasks will all be their own item, with attributes like completed/description
    - the user can create checklists, which will be arraylists of tasks and have their own method like add/complete task, etc.
The following is the ordered steps (obviously checking that eveyrthing works as we go on)
    - also make a date object which can be used when making a task
    - first create item class and its attributes and instance methods to update and act iteself
    - then make the checklist class after the item classs works
    - the difficult part will be the main program and having everything work (will probably need many methods and switches)
What has been done so far
    - date class basics have been made and tested
    - task class basics have been made and tested
    - task, date, and checklist complete with methods and variables

now need to work on the main method interface and userness
    - always print the current list
    - switch on many options (will use the scanner to take the data in)
        - make list
        - add/remove an item
        - clean list
        - complete an item
        - see if done with everything
    - always print list afterward

What has been done and needs to be done
    - all class files done very functionally
    - working on the main output and methods for each call to action 
        - methods in the main file as the individual instance methods have already been written


extras (not to do right now)
Can use date package to see if an item is out of date
Can make multiple lists
