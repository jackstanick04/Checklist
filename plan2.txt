So the program works without error with the current basic options,
Consider a way to clean up the main method and have more options

- checklist with items already known instanciation 
- check for dates out of date using date package (done)
- make multiple lists 
- make static methods for the different cases?

the way to do a lot of this:
- make an arraylist of checklists outside the main method (move scanner outside as well)
    - this will allow for static methods for the different cases and will not need parameters
