Console checklist program.
Can create, view, edit multiple checklists at once with user input in the console.
All checklists have multiple tasks that are defined by a description, date object (compared to the current date), and completion status.

Will now work to either use a database to store inputs or use a front end language to have outputs not just in the terminal.
