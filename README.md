Checklist ideas
    - display of lists (title and tasks)
    - tasks show the label, date due, completion status, and if overdue
    - create and delete options 
        - can create an empty or add items on creation
    - edit options (one list)
        - add an item
        - remove an item 
        - complete an item
        - clean the list (remove completed items and if entire list is done delete the list)
        - check list for entire completion

MainFile1 gives java console checklist program
MainFile2 gives java swing window checklist program

Console (mainfile1)
    - simple, clean, controlled by user input using Scanner
    - contains a lot of the background logic
    - utilitizes OOP, instance and static methods, Scanner for input
    - how it runs
        - user input controls what is printed (ex. see the lists, edit one, etc.)
Java Swing (mainfile2)
    - very, very fundamental (not super pretty)
    - utilizes buttons and text fields instead of integer input in the console
    - utilizes console classes for majority of the same logic
        - that is the logic not specific to swing
    - swing logic includes panels, labels, textfields, textareas, buttons, and aligning them all both horizontally and vertically
        - slight styling with fonts and borders
        - also uses inheritance
    - how it runs
        - home page that displays all lists, buttons to edit, create, and delete
        - edit, create, and delete pages all have specific inputs and then return to home page and reflect changes

Overall 
    - learned the basics of javaswing while refreshing major java oop concepts
    - worked very well in the console
    - got the swing to work effectively but not look the best
    - spent 25-30 hours

Improve
    - swing appearance
    - swing efficiency and consistency (probably some console effiiency improvements as well)

Went well
    - Comments, decent organization, good class files
    - Very strong console program
    - Learned basics of swing
    - Overall got the goal of the project to work logically in both formats
